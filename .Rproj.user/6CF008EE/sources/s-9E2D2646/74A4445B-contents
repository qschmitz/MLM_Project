#LET'S BEGIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN!
# ctrl-shift-c to comment/uncomment quickly
# I humbly suggest that we first try to answer each of these lines
# 
# 
# 4.1 First look of the data
# • Define:
#   – what are the independent experiment units (subjects, households, lots, ...)
# – the role of the different variables in your analysis:
#   ∗ which variable is the response ?
#   ∗ which variables are covariates ?
#   ∗ which variables are factors ?
#   ∗ Are the covariates and factors fixed or random effects ? (justify)
# ∗ Are the factors crossed, nested, ... ?
#   
# • Check if the class of your variables correspond to your needs:
#   – class numeric for the response
# – class numeric or integer covariates like age, ...
# – class factor or ordered for factors like subject, gender, ...
# • Write a first version of your model that include potential interactions
# 4.2 Exploratory data analysis
# • check if the model’s assumptions hold:
#   – linearity of the relation between the covariates and the response
# – equal variance of the responses around the different factor’s levels
# – presence or absence of interactions between the different “explanatory variables”
# – correlated or uncorrelated random effects ?
#   • get an impression of the variables potentially explanatory
# 4.3 Model building and hypotheses
# • Rewrite your model to take into account the results of the exploratory data analysis. If
# you have a doubt about the presence of a parameter (interaction between fixed factors,
#                                                     correlation between random effects), include it in the full model. It’s pertinence in
# the model will be tested.
# • Define precisely the hypotheses you want to test depending on the questions you wish
# to answer (Are you interested on the main effect of a factor or on its marginal effect
#            ?).
# 4.4 Model estimation
# • Estimate the postulated model.
# 4.5 Diagnostic analyses of the full model
# Before analyzing the results of your estimations, you have to determine the model is valid
# • check the residuals : are they iid N(0, σ2) ?
#   • check the random effects : are they iid N(0, σ2) ?
#   If not, try
# • a scale’s transformation of some variable (log of the response in the case of heteroscedasticity for example)
# • a quadratic form if non linearity of the influence of a covariate is suspected
# • to relax the assumption of equal variance of the observations around the levels of a
# factor
# • ...
# 4.6 Model selection
# Once the model is estimated and its validity checked, you may wish to determine with
# likelihood ratio tests if some of its parameters are significant or not with the aim of selecting
# a more parsimonious model. Suggestions:
#   • if the variance of random effect is small compared to the residual variance, this random
# effect may not be useful.
# • if the means of the responses for the levels of a factor seem the same, a model without
# that fixed factor may be more adequate.
# • ...
# The selected model should be re-checked as in 2.5.
# 4.7 Hypotheses
# Once you have selected the appropriate model, test the hypotheses you defined earlier.
